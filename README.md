# ReactJS Calculator

![](https://img.shields.io/badge/just%20for%20fun-blueviolet)

This is a simple calculator. I built it for ReactJS study. Thanks to [Leonardo Leit√£o](https://github.com/leonardomleitao), I watched some of his videos about web develop and he used this project to teach about React.
The difference about this calculator and its original it is:
- Full expression displayed
- Reload expression when the equals operator is pressed
- Float numbers with 2 decimal digits
